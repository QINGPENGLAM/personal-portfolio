      <p><span>Reflection</span><br><br>
        <span1>What materials did you use</span1><br><br>

        Tool I used Unity and research I used youtube, khan academy, internet (link at the end)<br><br>
        <span1>Briefly describe the overall process and steps. </span1> <br><br>
        Overall process is to determine what topic to choose from it will determine the scene you're creating 
        for example if you're doing artifact you will need the original location where it was found if you choose a artist 
        you will need a scene of that particular time period.<br><br>
        
        After choose my topic of art artifacts I start working on user interaction system since Im doing a game design where user were 
        able to interact I need to set the camera, the lighting, the texture, the model, the code. <br><br>
        
        Most of the time I'm just doing research when I run into trouble but when I finish up all the coding end
         I start doing artifact research the detail about the artifact, the picture, the origin, the material.<br><br>
        
        Tips for other who want to do similar CS project is plan out what needs to be done because you might have all the idea
         all at once but when it's all together you get confused easily. Google is your best friend.

         <p><span>Purpose + Goal</span><br><br> 
          <span1>Why did you pick this topic/ project? </span1><br><br>

  During the time I was learning computer programming and a mini game called oregon trail it's a 
  2D adventure game at beginning I was trying to apply the setting into this project and later 
  I found that its not that easy and when I search around on youtube I saw unity and I unity 
  is a efficient tool to create a game like project so I started my project.<br><br>

  <span1>As an artist: Describe your imagery and concept.  What visual components did you include?  
    What themes or ideas does your project express?
  </span1><br><br>

  Theme I want to express is that current society we dont have time and resources to experience what 
  happen to history and as technology becomes more advanced maybe we can design a VR that teaches art 
  history but in a fun and engaging way <br><br>

I try to be as specific as possible and be visual than wording.<br><br>

<span1>How would you approach it differently if you were to create this project again?
</span1><br><br>

If I would approach this project differently I would learned more of blender and animation because this
 project isn't just about coding and putting ideas together, theres alot of part to it. Also at the beginning
  I waste a lot of time trying to only used coding 
to present image and user interaction I should just start the unity part.<br><br>

<span1>How could you build upon your creative work and/ or research if you were to continue this theme?  
  What further questions and curiosities do you have?

</span1><br><br>

I would definitely continued this project and start get in touch with the modeling, 
more of the interaction such as minimap, onclick information, first person point of view, more better user interface like font style, texture, color, etc
